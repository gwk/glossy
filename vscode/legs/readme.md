* Add "*" to package.json activationEvents to enable.
* `npm install` to initialize the project.
* `npm run watch` to start the compiler in watch mode.
* open this folder in VS Code and run in debugger (default keybinding is `F5`).
* This will open the `[Extension Development Host]` window; open a file and observe the decorators.


* To customize colors, in user settings add:
    ```
    "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
        "myextension.largeNumberBackground": "#ff00ff"
    }
    ```
