# Pithy

Pithy is a small library of python utilities. Many of the functions are simple wrappers around standard library functions, but named to make scripts read more concisely. There are several families of functions with abbreviation conventions, e.g. errZ, errL, errSL, errLL all print to stderr, but with different `sep` and `end` values. Similarly, there is a family of 'run' functions for spawning subprocesses and then checking or returning various combinations of exit status code, stdout, and stderr.

The result is that code may look a bit more cryptic or less traditional, but is made more correct and concise by handling boring details like stdout versus stderr and error checking/reporting minutiae correctly.

The project is hosted at 'https://github.com/gwk/pithy'.

Because many of these functions are trivial in themselves, and can be easily used by copying them into small scripts, this project is dedicated to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 dedication: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/. Although no attribution is required, attribution and feedback are very much appreciated.


# Installation

$ pip3 install pithy


# Development

Alternatively, pip can install packages in 'develop' mode as follows:
$ pip3 install -e .

This method tells python to find the module at the current working directory; changes to the working directory will be visible to the python3 installation.


# Issues

Please file issues to the github repository.
